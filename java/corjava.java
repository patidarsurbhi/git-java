1.java Standard Editiond(JSE)
2.java Enterprise Edition(JEE)
3.java Micro Edidtion(JME)

1.  JAVA SE(java Standard Edidtion)
 it is java programming platform .it is includes java API such as java.lang,java.util,java.io,java.math etc . it is includes core java 
more topics like oops ,String,Exception , Inner Class,Collection etc.

2.JAVA EE(java Enterprise Edition)
it is an eneteprise platform that is mainly used to devlop web and enterprise application. it includes topics like Servlet , JSP,Websevices,EJB,JPA,etc.


3. JAVA ME(java Micro Edition)
it is micro platform that is used to mobile application.



Q.....what are the java Applications.
ANS:-There are four types of java application in java programming.
1.Standalone Application : 
2.Enterprise Application:
3.Web Application:
4.Mobile Application:

1.java standalone application in usess GUI components such as AWT ,Swing , and JavaFX.These components contain buttons ,list,menu,scroll,panel,etc,it is also Known as desktop alienations.


2.Enterprise Application :->An Application  which is distributed in nature is called enterprise application.

3.Web Application:->web application used in run on server.we use Servlet, jsp,Spring and Hibernate technologies for creating web application.

Q...............
ans.:-> Features of Java

1.Simple
2.Object-Oriented
3.Robust
4.Secure
5.Plateform-independent
6.portanle
7.high Performance
8.Distributed
9.Multi-threaded

1.Sinple: Java is a simple language because its syntax is simple, clean, and easy to understand. Complex and ambiguous concepts of C++ are either eliminated or re-implemented in Java. For example, pointer and operator overloading are not used in Java.

2.Object-Oriented: In Java, everything is in the form of the object. It means it has some data and behavior. A program must have at least one class and object.


3.Robust: Java makes an effort to check error at run time and compile time. It uses a strong memory management system called garbage collector. Exception handling and garbage collection features make it strong.


4.Secure: Java is a secure programming language because it has no explicit pointer and programs runs in the virtual machine. Java contains a security manager that defines the access of Java classes.


5.Platform-Independent: Java provides a guarantee that code writes once and run anywhere. This byte code is platform-independent and can be run on any machine.

6.Portable: Java Byte code can be carried to any platform. No implementation-dependent features. Everything related to storage is predefined, for example, the size of primitive data types.

7.High Performance: Java is an interpreted language. Java enables high performance with the use of the Just-In-Time compiler.

8.Distributed: Java also has networking facilities. It is designed for the distributed environment of the internet because it supports TCP/IP protocol. It can run over the internet. EJB and RMI are used to create a distributed system.

9.Multi-threaded: Java also supports multi-threading. It means to handle more than one job a time.
